    <h1>Aerodynamics Workshop:</h1>
    <p>Aerodynamics committee aims to give general knowledge about car dynamics, air properties and forces affecting the car, also how to use the aerodynamics to our advantage. </p>
    <h3>Workshop Content :</h3>
    <ul>
    <p>- Basics of flying + introduction for plane design</p>
    <p>- what is lift, drag, thrust.</p>
    <p>- pressure difference that cause lift.</p>
    <p>- Main forces on a moving body.</p>
    <p>- what is an airfoil, and angle of attack.</p>
    <p>- types of airfoils (NACA 4-digit) ,drag. , flow.</p>
    <p>- separation of flow.</p>
    <p>- main parts and what can be removed.</p>
    <p>- plane parts (fuselage, wing, landing gears, tail + extra components "amap")</p>
    <p>- stability about the 3 axes, and the parts/variables affecting them.</p>
    <p>- intro to xflr5.</p>
    <p>- importing NACA airfoils, analysis of their properties.</p>
    <p>- creating a plane (wing + tail + fin)</p>
    <p>- knowing how to adjust curves.</p>
    <p>- reaching good lift/drag/stability"cm" curves.</p>
    <p>- basics of sketching and drawing.</p>
    <p>- importing an airfoil to solidworks.</p>
    <p>- features such as (extruding, cutting, revolving, lofting).</p>
    <p>- extra techniques such as (creating swept/twisted wing, deleting/mirroring bodies).</p>
    <p>- different assembling and mating techniques.</p>
    <p>- difference between aerodynamics of cars and planes.</p>
    <p>- aerodynamic devices for normal cars.</p>
